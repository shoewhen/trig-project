            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The Tau vs. Pi debate is intense within the mathematics realm, and I’ve chosen to 
                contribute my own opinions and thoughts to this heated controversy, just because I 
                totally chose to do this on my own and didn’t have a math teacher assign this as a project. 
                To quickly summarize what Pi and Tau are, here's the definition I've known them by:
            </p>
            <div class="tau-pi-defs">
                <p>
                    Pi is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, represented by the greek letter π
                    <br><br>
                    Tau is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius, represented by the greek letter τ. Tau can be thought of as "two Pi."
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In order to make this project a little more interesting, I decided to create a webpage with some Manim animations to aid in my explanations of the questions presented. I haven’t programmed in Python in a while, and I’ve also never used Manim before, so this will certainly be an endeavoring journey. But that’s okay, because it’s all for the grade anyways (satire).
            </p>

            <h1>The Tau Unit Circle</h1>
            <p>There isn't anything super special about this. It's just a unit circle but instead of using π I just converted every angle to τ. This can be done pretty easily by just dividing each angle of a π unit circle by two and then changing the π sign to a τ sign.</p>

            <h2>\(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{8}\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{8}\right)\)</h2>
            <p>
                \(\tau \over8\) is also equivalent to \(\pi \over 4\) or 45°. Using the unit circle, you can 
                easily find the values of \(\sin{\tau \over 8}\) and \(\cos{\tau \over 8}\). Since cosine 
                and sine can be redefined as the x and y distance from the origin to a point on the unit 
                circle, you just need to find the terminal point when you rotate \(\tau \over8\) radians 
                counterclockwise around the unit circle. The x-coordinate of the terminal point will be the 
                value of \(\cos{\tau \over 8}\), and the y-coordinate will be the value of \(\sin{\tau \over 8}\). 
                I’ve created an animation below to help visualize what this would look like on the unit circle.
            </p>

            </video>
            <p>
                As the animation shows, \(\tau\over8\) is within the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, so all values 
                of sine and cosine will always be positive. The terminal point which corresponds to this angle is 
                \(\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\).
            </p>
            <h2>\(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{6}\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{6}\right)\)</h2>
            <p>
                \(\frac{\tau}{6}\) is also equivalent to \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) or 60°.  This angle lies within the first 
                quadrant, where sine and cosine are always positive. The terminal point which corresponds to this angle 
                is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)\).
            </p>

            <h2>\(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{4}\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{4}\right)\)</h2>
            <p>
                \(\frac{\tau}{4}\) is also equivalent to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), or 90°. This angle lies on the x-axis and
                within the upper two quadrants of the coordinate plane. Since this angle lies on the x-axis, the terminal 
                point of this angle corresponds to \(\left(0, 1 \right)\), as there is a negligible x-distance. 
                Additionally, this angle also lies within the upper two quadrants of the coordinate 
                plane, so the y-coordinate of the terminal point is at its greatest value of 1.

            <h2>\(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{3}\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{3}\right)\)</h2>
            <p>
                \(\frac{\tau}{3}\) is also equivalent to \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\), or 120°. This angle lies within the second 
                quadrant, where all the trigonometric functions are negative except for sine (reasonably, cosecant is 
                positive as well). The terminal point which corresponds to this angle is 
                \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)\).

            <h2>\(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2}\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{2}\right)\)</h2>
            <p>
                \(\frac{\tau}{2}\) is also equivalent to π, or 180°. This angle lies on the y-axis and between the second 
                and third quadrants. Since this angle lies on the y-axis, the terminal point of this angle corresponds to 
                \(\left(-1, 0 \right)\), as there is a negligible y-distance. Additionally, this angle also lies between 
                the two left quadrants of the coordinate plane, so the x-coordinate of the terminal point is at its 
                smallest value of -1.

            <p>
                \(\frac{7\tau}{8}\) is also equivalent to \(\frac{7\pi}{4}\), or 315°. This angle lies within the fourth 
                quadrant, where all the trigonometric functions are negative except for cosine (secant is positive as well). 
                The terminal point which corresponds to this angle is \(\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)\).
