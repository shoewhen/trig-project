                    <p>
                        The Tau vs. Pi debate is intense within the mathematics realm, and I’ve chosen to 
                        contribute my own opinions and thoughts to this heated controversy, just because I 
                        totally chose to do this on my own and didn’t have a math teacher assign this as a project. 
                        To quickly summarize what Pi and Tau are, here's the definition I've known them by:
                    </p>
                    <div class="tau-pi-defs">
                        <p>
                            Pi is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, represented by the greek letter \(\pi\)
                            <br><br>
                            Tau is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius, represented by the greek letter \(\tau\). Tau can be thought of as "two \(\pi\)."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        \(\tau\) is equal to “two \(\pi\)” since the radius of a circle is half its diameter, so in order to compensate for this difference, 
                        \(\tau\) is twice as big as \(\pi\). For example, \(\pi\) is equivalent to 180°, so \(\frac{\tau}{2}\) is also equivalent to 180°. 
                        This means that \(\tau\) itself is equivalent to 360°, also known as one whole revolution around a circle. There are many 
                        applications of using \(\tau\), and some may even say it even redefines trigonometry as a whole. This webpage explores the 
                        applications of \(\tau\) by answering some simple trigonometry questions using this circle coefficient. In addition, I’ve also 
                        included math animations (Manim) which I programmed using Python to accompany each question in order to help visualize my thought 
                        process while answering these problems.

                <h1>The Tau Unit Circle</h1>
                <p>
                    There isn't anything super special about this. It's just a unit circle but instead of using \(\pi\) I just 
                    converted every angle to \(\tau\). This can be done pretty easily by just dividing each angle of a \(\pi\) unit 
                    circle by two and then changing the \(\pi\) sign to a \(\tau\) sign.

                <p>
                    The rest of this section will use the tau unit circle I created above to find the exact values of sine 
                    and cosine for the following angles:
                </p>

                    <p>\(\frac{\tau}{4}\)</p>

                    <p>\(\frac{7\tau}{8}\)</p>
                </div>
                <h2>\(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{8}\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{8}\right)\)</h2>
                <p>
                    \(\tau \over8\) is also equivalent to \(\pi \over 4\) or 45°. Using the unit circle, you can 
                    easily find the values of \(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{8}\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{8}\right)\). Since cosine 
                    and sine can be redefined as the x and y distance from the origin to a point on the unit 
                    circle, you just need to find the terminal point when you rotate \(\tau \over8\) radians 
                    counterclockwise around the unit circle. The x-coordinate of the terminal point will be the 
                    value of \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{8}\right)\), and the y-coordinate will be the value of \(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{8}\right)\). 
                    I’ve created an animation below to help visualize what this would look like on the unit circle.
                </p>

                </video>
                <p>
                    As the animation shows, \(\tau\over8\) is within the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, so all values 
                    of sine and cosine will always be positive. The terminal point which corresponds to this angle is 
                    \(\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\).

                <p>
                    \(\frac{\tau}{6}\) is also equivalent to \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) or 60°.  This angle lies within the first 
                    quadrant, where sine and cosine are always positive. The terminal point which corresponds to this angle 
                    is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)\). Thus, \(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{6}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and 
                    \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{6}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\).

                <p>
                    \(\frac{\tau}{4}\) is also equivalent to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), or 90°. This angle lies on the x-axis and
                    within the upper two quadrants of the coordinate plane. Since this angle lies on the x-axis, the terminal 
                    point of this angle corresponds to \(\left(0, 1 \right)\), as there is a negligible x-distance. 
                    Additionally, this angle also lies within the upper two quadrants of the coordinate 
                    plane, so the y-coordinate of the terminal point is at its greatest value of 1. This means that 
                    \(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{4}\right)=1\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{4}\right)=0\).

                    \(\frac{\tau}{3}\) is also equivalent to \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\), or 120°. This angle lies within the second 
                    quadrant, where all the trigonometric functions are negative except for sine (cosecant is 
                    positive as well). The terminal point which corresponds to this angle is 
                    \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)\). Hence, \(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{3}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and

                    \(\frac{\tau}{2}\) is also equivalent to π, or 180°. This angle lies on the y-axis and between the second 
                    and third quadrants. Since this angle lies on the y-axis, the terminal point of this angle corresponds to 
                    \(\left(-1, 0 \right)\), as there is a negligible y-distance. Additionally, this angle also lies between 
                    the two left quadrants of the coordinate plane, so the x-coordinate of the terminal point is at its 
                    smallest value of -1. Therefore, \(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2}\right)=0\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{2}\right)=-1\).

                    about this question by visualizing what \(\cos\alpha\) might look like. As I’m already aware that 
                    \(\cos{\theta}=\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}\), and \(\sin{\theta}=\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}\), I’m able to create a triangle out of this information. In order to find the missing side of the triangle, I can utilize the Pythagorean Theorem. I’ve created an animation to help explain my thought process.

                    Theta is in the third quadrant of the cartesian plane, where all trigonometry functions are negative except for tangent 
                    (and cotangent). This means that \(\sin\left(\theta\right)\) and \(\sin\left(\theta\right)\) will be negative. Referencing 
                    the animation, the angle alpha has been preserved in the reference angle of theta, so visually, the shape of our original 
                    triangle has not changed. However, since our triangle is now in the third quadrant, this means that both the horizontal and 
                    vertical lengths of the triangle are now negative. This results in cosine \(\left(\frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}\right)\) and 
                    sine \(\left(\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}\right)\) to be negative as well. Therefore, \(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{2}+\alpha\right)=-\frac{12}{13}\) 
                    and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{2}+\alpha\right)=-\frac{5}{13}\)

                <p>
                    \(\tau-\alpha\) means that there is one full rotation of a circle, and then we are turning back \(\alpha\) radians. The 
                    reference angle stays the same, once again preserving the original shape of our triangle. Additionally, \(\theta\) is now in the 
                    fourth quadrant of the cartesian plane. This means that all trigonometry functions are negative except for cosine (and secant). 
                    As we already know that sine and cosine are equal to the ratio of the opposite and the adjacent side lengths of a right 
                    triangle, respectively, we can determine that \(\cos\left(\tau-\alpha\right)=\frac{5}{13}\) and

                    rotation of \(\frac{\tau}{2}\) radians. Once again, we are subtracting \(\alpha\) from this angle, therefore rotating
                    backwards (clockwise) \(\alpha\) radians. Our reference angle has stayed the same (\(\alpha\)), therefore the shape of our 
                    triangle has also been preserved within this circle. Now our triangle is in the second quadrant, where all trigonometry 
                    functions are negative except for sine (and cosecant). This means that cosine will be negative. We are resulted with 
                    \(\sin\left(\frac{3\tau}{2}-\alpha\right)=\frac{12}{13}\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{3\tau}{2}-\alpha\right)=-\frac{5}{13}\).

                    somewhat preserved, except that the longer leg is now the horizontal leg and the shorter leg is now the vertical leg. Once 
                    again, our angle is in the second quadrant of the cartesian plane, meaning that all trigonometry functions are negative 
                    except for sine (and cosecant). Additionally, since the lengths of our original triangle have been switched in our current 
                    triangle, so have the values of sine and cosine. The animation shows that \(\sin\left(\frac{\tau}{4}+\alpha\right)=\frac{5}{13}\) 
                    and \(\cos\left(\frac{\tau}{4}+\alpha\right)=-\frac{12}{13}\).

                <p>
                    If the sine of an angle is positive, then we already know that this angle lies in both the first and second quadrant of a cartesian 
                    plane. If we first restrict the value of theta to between 0 and \(\tau\), then we can determine that there are only two angles that 
                    satisfy this equation: one in the first quadrant, and one in the second quadrant. Using the tau unit circle, we can determine the two 
                    angles where \(\sin\left(\theta\right)=\frac{1}{2}\). These two angles are \(\frac{\tau}{12}\) and \(\frac{5\tau}{12}\). In the 
                    animation below, you can see that when \(\sin\left(\theta\right)=\frac{1}{2}\), the vertical distance of the point on the unit circle 
                    from the x-axis is \(\frac{1}{2}\). This is one of the definitions of \(\sin\left(\theta\right)\): the vertical distance from a point on the unit circle to the x-axis. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Now what if we unrestrict the value of \(\theta\)? This gives us infinite solutions of \(\theta\). This is because you can infinitely 
                    add on more full rotations around the unit circle, and the angle will always end up on the same spot in the unit circle. We already 
                    know that \(\frac{5\tau}{12}\) is one solution to this equation, so we can indefinitely add \(\tau\) to \(\frac{5\tau}{12}\) and 
                    always end up in the same position in the unit circle. The same goes for \(\frac{\tau}{12}\)! The equation looks like this:

                <p>
                    Make note that \(k\) is a whole number constant, otherwise we wouldn’t be adding full rotations to our original angle.

                    The cosine of \(\theta\) is negative, indicating that \(\theta\) lies in both the second and third quadrants of the cartesian plane. 
                    Using the same method we used to solve for theta in the previous question, we can determine that there are only two angles that satisfy 
                    this equation: one in the second quadrant and one in the third quadrant. The tau unit circle indicates that \(\theta\) is equal to 
                    \(\frac{5\tau}{12}\) and \(\frac{7\tau}{12}\). Just like how \(\sin\left(\theta\right)\) is the vertical distance from a point on the 
                    unit circle to the x-axis, \(\cos\left(\theta\right)\) is the horizontal distance from a point on the unit circle to the y-axis. 
                    Unrestricting the value of \(\theta\) will give us infinite solutions of \(\theta\). The equation looks like this:

                    three full cycles of the function within one \(\tau\). This makes a lot more sense than saying that the period is \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\), 
                    meaing there are three full cycles within \(2\pi\). Using \(\tau\) in this instance makes graphing trigonometric functions much easier

                    because sine and cosine are complementary functions, and always off by \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), or \(\frac{\tau}{4}\). By shifting 
                    \(f\left(x\right)\) \(\frac{\tau}{4}\) units to the right, the graph maps onto the graph of \(y=\sin\left(x\right)\).

                    \(f\left(x\right)=\sin\left(x\right)\). The function has a period of \(\frac{\tau}{2}\), an amplitude of 1, a midline at 
                    \(y=0\), and a phase shift of \(\frac{\tau}{4}\) units. The reason why the phase shift is not \(\frac{\tau}{2}\) and is 
                    instead \(\frac{\tau}{4}\) is because the phase shift of a sine function in the form \(y=\sin\left(ax-b\right)\) is given 
                    by the formula \(\frac{b}{a}\). In the given graph, \(a=2\) and \(b=\frac{\tau}{2}\). Therefore the phase shift is 
                    \(\frac{\frac{\tau}{2}}{2}=\frac{\tau}{4}\).  The animation below shows how \(y=\sin\left(2x-\frac{\tau}{2}\right)\) is

                    After watching the animation, you may have noticed that the horizontal shift by \(\tau\) units did not change the graph. Visibly, you 
                    are correct. This is because subtracting \(\tau\) from the argument of the cosine function doesn't alter its behavior due to the 
                    periodic nature of the cosine function, which has an original period of \(\tau\).

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    My conclusion to this debate is that I find it rather silly. Of course I have my own opinion on which circle constant is superior, 
                    however, I must state that in the end, I truly couldn’t care that much. After reading a few articles on why one of these circle 
                    constants is better than the other, this debate just seems to be running in circles rather than concluding in anything remotely useful. 
                    It feels more like two siblings arguing over which ice cream flavor is better, when in all honesty it’s only a matter of preference 
                    for the individual. My sister loves pistachio flavored ice cream, while my favorite is coffee flavored. I could not be more repulsed 
                    by pistachio flavored food, yet there are people out there that love it, such as my sister. The same goes for these circle constants. 
                    Some people feel strongly about which is better, and find it despicable that others even dare to use the opposing circle constant. As 
                    I previously stated, I really couldn’t care about whether tau or pi is better, but for the sake of this project, I’ve decided that pi 
                    is the superior circle constant. Even though this project was all about using tau to solve trigonometry problems, I’ve chosen to be 
                    stubborn instead of reasonable. Read my thoughts on why pi is the better circle constant in
