            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The Tau vs. Pi debate is intense within the mathematics realm, and I’ve chosen to 
                contribute my own opinions and thoughts to this heated controversy, just because I 
                totally chose to do this on my own and didn’t have a math teacher assign this as a project. 
                To quickly summarize what Pi and Tau are, here's the definition I've known them by:
            </p>
            <div class="tau-pi-defs">
                <p>Pi is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, represented by the greek letter π</p>
                <p>Tau is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius, represented by the greek letter τ. Tau can be thought of as "two Pi."</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In order to make this project a little more interesting, I decided to create a webpage with some Manim animations to aid in my explanations of the questions presented. I haven’t programmed in Python in a while, and I’ve also never used Manim before, so this will certainly be an endeavoring journey. But that’s okay, because it’s all for the grade anyways (satire).
            </p>

            <h1>The Tau Unit Circle</h1>
            <p>There isn't anything super special about this. It's just a unit circle but instead of using π I just converted every angle to τ. This can be done pretty easily by just dividing each angle of a π unit circle by two and then changing the π sign to a τ sign.</p>

            <h2>\(\sin{\tau \over 8}\) and \(\cos{\tau \over 8}\)</h2>
            <p>
                \(\tau \over8\) is also equivalent to \(\pi \over 4\) or 45°. Using the unit circle, you can 
                easily find the values of \(\sin{\tau \over 8}\) and \(\cos{\tau \over 8}\). Since cosine 
                and sine can be redefined as the x and y distance from the origin to a point on the unit 
                circle, you just need to find the terminal point when you rotate \(\tau \over8\) radians 
                counterclockwise around the unit circle. The x-coordinate of the terminal point will be the 
                value of \(\cos{\tau \over 8}\), and the y-coordinate will be the value of \(\sin{\tau \over 8}\). 
                I’ve created an animation below to help visualize what this would look like on the unit circle.
