            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                The Tau vs. Pi debate is intense within the mathematics realm, and I’ve chosen to 
                contribute my own opinions and thoughts to this heated controversy, just because I 
                totally chose to do this on my own and didn’t have a math teacher assign this as a project. 
                To quickly summarize what Pi and Tau are, here's the definition I've known them by:
            </p>
            <div class="tau-pi-defs">
                <p>Pi is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, represented by the greek letter π</p>
                <p>Tau is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius, represented by the greek letter τ</p>
            </div>
            <p>Additionally, Tau is often said to just be "two Pi," as in "Pi times two."</p>

            <h1>The Tau Unit Circle</h1>
            <p>There isn't anythinig super special about this. It's just a unit circle but instead of using π 
                I just used τ. Also this was hell to code cuz it was the first time I've ever tried Manim 
                and I wanted to kill myself.</p>
