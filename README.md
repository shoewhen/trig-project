# Precalculus BC Trigonometry Project

My dearest teacher Shaun Errichiello assigned this project for a mere 50 points, yet here I am making myself suffer so much when I could've just written an essay. Alas, I present thee with this completed project. It's a simple webpage that answers the questions assigned to us as students, each accompanied with a Manim animation. My brain hurts.
