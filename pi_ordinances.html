                I must first begin by clarifying that I do firmly believe \(\pi\) is better than using \(\tau\), even after I said I don’t really care. Basically, if I were to use a circle constant, I’d always resort to using \(\pi\) instead of \(\tau\). Before I get into all the mathematical details on why \(\pi\) is better than \(\tau\), I must state that the actual reason why I like \(\pi\) is just because I’ve used it for so long. I only learned about \(\tau\) last year, and even then I thought it was a waste of time to switch to using a different circle constant than what I was used to. Using \(\pi\) satisfied me, and it’s not like there were problems out there that I needed to solve which required me to use \(\tau\) instead of \(\pi\). I was (and still am) perfectly content using \(\pi\), and I just don’t feel that compelled to change my point of view. As the saying goes, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
                <br><br>
                Many \(\tau\) supporters believe that \(\tau\) is more useful since \(2\pi\) appears so frequently throughout mathematics. For example “The Tau Manifesto” cites that integrals over all space in polar coordinates, the Gaussian (normal) distribution, the Fourier transform, and Cauchy’s integral formula are just “a few examples” of how frequently \(2\pi\) occurs throughout formulas (Hartl). However, in response to this claim I must contend with “The Pi Manifesto” that using \(\tau\) instead of \(\pi\) also has the potential to complicate formulas. According to “The Pi Manifesto,” “The Tau Manifesto” specifically pinpoints formulas which contain \(2\pi\), and just replaces it with \(\tau\), when in reality they are ignoring other functions that could become worse when replacing \(\pi\) with \(\tau\) (MSC). One simple example is the surface area of a torus: 
                \(\pi^2\left(2\right)\left(R^2-r^2\right)\) (Numberphile). Changing this equation to use \(\tau\) instead of \(\pi\) only further complicates the calculation, and it’s just redundant overall. Feel free to check out section 7 of “The Pi Manifesto” for more functions where \(\tau\) isn’t involved. Now, I won’t pretend that I understand all the complex formulas which I previously stated, but I personally don’t see why we have to switch to using \(\tau\) in place of \(\pi\) when \(\pi\) has always worked.

                From a more simplified point of view, one could also say that the radius is used to define a circle, that is, the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point, with the distance being equal to the radius. Yet, it is crucial to note that the radius can only be found from the diameter, a relationship which requires the division of the diameter by two in order to find the radius (Brown). This makes the diameter an essential part to learning more about a circle’s dimensions. So my question is, why must we complicate things even more by using \(\tau\)?
                <br><br>
                Something I noticed about “The Pi Manifesto” was its reasoning  for why the main argument for \(\tau\) is “silly.” It states that \(\tau\) makes it simple to calculate the number of radians in a fraction of a circle, but the same reasoning can be applied to calculate the area of a fraction of the unit circle. For example, in a circle, you turn \(\frac{\tau}{4}\) radians to turn a quarter of the circle. But then let’s say you’re trying to find a fraction of the area of a unit circle. The area of the full circle is equal to \(\frac{\tau}{2}\), half the circle is equal to \(\frac{\tau}{4}\), a quarter being equal to \(\frac{\tau}{8}\), and so on. However, using \(\pi\) in this instance makes calculations cleaner. The area of the full circle is equal to \(\pi\), half the circle equals \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), a quarter equals \(\frac{\pi}{4}\), and so on (MSC). It’s true that in some situations \(\tau\) may be better, while in other cases \(\pi\) is better. However, “The Tau Manifesto” fails to convince the reader that \(\pi\) is a worthy opponent to the argument of \(\tau\) because of its selection bias: it only praises \(\tau\), ignoring situations where \(\tau\) is worse.
                <br><br>
                There are truly a multitude of reasons as to why one circle constant is better than the other, and you may have noticed that I’ve only been 
                speaking on why \(\pi\) is better than \(\tau\) and failed to mention the limitations of \(\pi\). To continue my streak of honesty, I completely 
                understand why some mathematicians feel so strongly about \(\tau\). I admit that “The Tau Manifesto” does a great job at convincing the reader 
                as to why \(\tau\) is so much more superior than \(\pi\). There is so much more to this debate than the to\(\pi\)cs which I briefly mentioned, 
                but I’ve decided to conclude here so then I don’t act like I know what I’m saying when I really have no clue (like what in the world is Euler’s 
                formula?! It sure sounds cool and I’ve seen it mentioned a lot while researching this debate, but I came to the realization that I have a long 
                way to go as a mathematician before I try to convince myself I can understand this stuff). In the end, I’ve come to the same conclusion which I 
                previously drew: this debate is purely a matter of preference. Do whatever you want! Both circle constants work! Using \(\pi\) in some instances 
                may be better than \(\tau\) and vice versa. No one is limited to using just one circle constant for the rest of their life, so why subject 
                ourselves to this debate which only leads us in circles? Personally, I’ll still be using \(\pi\), but only for the first reason I stated, which 
                was that I've been using this circle constant since day one. I’m fairly certain that if I were taught to use \(\tau\) instead of \(\pi\) that I’d
                provide the same reasoning and become a \(\tau\) supporter. Even after this project, I don’t feel strongly about which one I like better and 
                I’d prefer it if we could all collectively agree that they both have their ups and downs (why can’t we all hold hands and be friends).

                What you see below was my original plan for this project, which was to continue the pi vs. tau debate by giving absurd reasons as to 
                why pi was better, but with a twist. You might realize that the rhetoric used is hardly decipherable, as I wanted to write this in the
                tone of someone writing "The Virginia Resolves." I initially thought it'd be a bit funny, but it turned out to be too difficult for me 
                to continue. Nonetheless, I didn't want my work to go to waste so I just plopped it down below in case anyone actually found it
                interesting. Enjoy!

                    Resolved that I, Shaine Wei, student of studies under the pedagogical guidance of our over-caffeinated and wise elder, Shaun Errichiello, in room H202 of our illustrious institution of study, chair of the administration position of the technical club, Code Red Robotics, and TSA, hold an authoritative standing to judge that pi, expressed by the Greek symbol, π, is the superior circle constant, in opposition to the foolish and dim-witted belief that tau, expressed by the Greek symbol, τ, can be deemed as on a remotely equal precedence to pi, as granted to me by the federal government of the United States of America, the land of the free, and the sovereign nation situated in North America, under my first amendment right.

                    Resolved that pi, the original and superior circle constant, has sustained throughout tradition, and graced the realms of mathematical discourse for countless centuries. The illustrious pi has stood as the solitary and esteemed symbol, woven into the very fabric of mathematical heritage. This sacred constant, endowed with the wisdom of the ages, has been an inseparable companion to the minds of scholars–a companion whose roots delve deep into the hallowed grounds of mathematical exploration.

                    Resolved that pi, the original and venerable circle constant, shares a phonetic resemblance akin to the pronunciation of the noun “pie”–a deletable confection which graces our palates with sweetness and embodies the essence of culinary indulgence. Given, that we celebrate the honorous day, Pi Day, during the light of the fourteenth day of the third month of each year, with the dessert they call “pie,” the tradition of this day shall be maintained most profoundly for until the last digit of pi is named.
